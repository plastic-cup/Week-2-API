##Function
Our app allows users to filter photos by hashtag and recolour them.



This involves implementing:
* RGB manipulation
* A way for users to search by hashtag
* Interacting with Instagram API
* Sensitive handling of API keys


##Access   
The code must currently be run on the localhost, including a file named alohomora.txt containing our access token. (ask us if you want to test it).

### How to run?
If you want to run Colorizerr you need an API key -> Which you can get from [Here](https://instagram.com/developer/) -> just add you access token to a file alohomora.txt
