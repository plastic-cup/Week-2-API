# the Instagram webapp

*in progress*

##Function
Our app allows users to filter photos by hashtag and recolour them.

This involves implementing:
* RGB manipulation
* A way for users to search by hashtag
* Interacting with Instagram API
* Sensitive handling of API keys

##Use  
The code must currently be run on the localhost, including a file named alohomora.txt containing our access token. (ask us if you want to test it).
